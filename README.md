# DStv Zimbabwe — Customer Query Insight & Action Recommender

A prescriptive analytics application that analyzes customer support queries for DStv Zimbabwe and recommends operational actions to reduce escalations and improve customer experience.

# The Problem
DStv Zimbabwe handles thousands of customer support interactions every month across call centers, walk-in centers, and digital channels. These queries range from common technical issues such as E16 signal errors and decoder faults to payment failures, subscription renewals, and account suspensions.

Customer service managers face three persistent challenges. First, issues are often identified after they have already escalated, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and repeat calls. Second, traditional dashboards show what is happening but not why it is happening or what actions should be taken. Third, high-volume issues tend to overwhelm agents and supervisors, making it difficult to prioritize interventions across regions and categories.

As a result, operational teams spend more time reacting to problems instead of proactively preventing them. This leads to longer resolution times, higher escalation rates, and increased pressure on support teams.

# The Solution

This project introduces a prescriptive analytics tool that goes beyond reporting to actively recommend actions.
The application automatically:
- Analyzes historical customer query data
- Classifies incoming queries into common issue categories
- Detects recent spikes and emerging trends
- Predicts which tickets are likely to escalate
- Generates actionable recommendations for managers

Instead of asking “What happened?”, the system answers:
**“What is happening now, what is likely to happen next, and what should we do about it?”**

The intelligence comes from combining:
- Machine learning (text classification + escalation prediction)
- Analytics (trend detection and regional insights)
- Rule-based decision logic (prescriptive recommendations tied to business actions)

# How It Works

1. Step 1: Customer query data is loaded or uploaded into the system
2. Step 2: The system analyzes query text, categories, regions, and resolution times
3. Step 3: Managers receive insights, risk scores, and recommended actions

# The Analytics Behind It
**- Data Used**
      - Customer query text
      - Issue category
      - Region (all Zimbabwe provinces)
      - Resolution time
      - Escalation outcome

**- Models**
     - TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for query classification
     - Random Forest for escalation prediction
     - Prescriptive Logic
     - Issue spikes trigger operational recommendations
     - High escalation risk triggers supervisor intervention
     - Regional concentration triggers targeted technical responses

# Example Output

Example recommendations generated by the system:
- “E16 error spike detected — initiate signal uplink diagnostics and send proactive SMS to affected regions.”
- “Payment failures increasing — audit payment gateway and notify billing operations.”
- “High escalation probability (82%) — recommend immediate supervisor review.”

The dashboard also displays:
- Query trends over time
- Top issue categories
- Escalation rates
- Regional distributions

# Technology Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Analytics & ML: Python, pandas, scikit-learn
- Text Processing: TF-IDF Vectorization
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Data: Synthetic DStv Zimbabwe customer query dataset (2,000 records)

# Future Possibilities
With more time and real production data, this system could be expanded to:
- Integrate live call-center or CRM data
- Automatically trigger SMS or WhatsApp notifications
- Add optimization for staffing and resource allocation
- Incorporate customer churn prediction
- Deploy as a full decision-support system across African markets

This project demonstrates how analytics + intelligence + recommendations can directly support real operational decisions in media and telecommunications.
